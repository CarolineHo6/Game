      "description": "You are standing in the main entrance hall, where sunlight spills through tall glass doors and reflects off the smooth tile floor. The space feels open and busy—students pass through, voices low and hurried. To the west, a wide doorway leads to the theatre. To the east, a hallway stretches toward the cafeteria and library. Straight ahead, a staircase descends to the lower floor. Artwork and announcements line the walls, giving the space a lived-in feel.",
