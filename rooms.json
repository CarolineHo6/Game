The space feels open and busy—students pass through, voices low and hurried. To the west, a wide doorway leads to the theatre. To the east, a hallway stretches toward the cafeteria and library. Straight ahead, a staircase descends to the lower floor. Artwork and announcements line the walls, giving the space a lived-in feel.",
